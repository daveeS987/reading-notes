## Read 26: Component Based UI

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)  
   Vue, angular, ember, preact, next
1. What’s the difference between a framework and a library?  
   When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.

### Vocabulary Terms

- Rendering - Rendering is the process of gathering data (if any) and load the associated templates (or just send the output directly). Then apply the gathered data to the associated templates. The final output is sent to the user.
- Templates - refers to the client side data binding method implemented with the JavaScript language.
- State - an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.
