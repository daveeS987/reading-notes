- Scikit-learn is a python module for machine learning - It contains functions for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction.

- Y - "target" data in Python
- X - independent variables
- Important functions to keep in mind while fitting a linear regression model are:
  - lm.fit() -> fits a linear model
  - lm.predict() -> Predict Y using the linear model with estimated coefficients
  - lm.score() -> Returns the coefficient of determination (R^2). A measure of how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model, as the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model.
  - You can also explore the functions inside lm object by pressing lm.<tab>
